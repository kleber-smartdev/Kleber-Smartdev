### 🥰 I love people’s interactions and how we can do more together.
I truly believe that our differences contribute to better solutions because we can tackle different angles simultaneously.<br>
I would love to have more time to share more about my professional skills.

### 🔥 I have been working in the digital industry for more than a decade.
In 2009, I started to work with multicultural teams across the globe. In 2013 I had a short business program in Toronto, Canada.<br>
When I returned to São Paulo, Brazil resuming my digital career there; I started to think about immigrating to Canada for better opportunities. In 2016 I moved to Vancouver, Canada, where I have been developing my skills.

### During my time off I love to spend time doing... 👨‍👩‍👦 🚵 🎮 🏕️ ✈️
